Real-Time Emotion Detection and Screen Time Tracker

Project Overview: The Real-Time Emotion Detection and Screen Time Tracker is a Python application that combines two powerful features:

Emotion Detection: It analyzes faces captured by your webcam and predicts the dominant emotion (e.g., happy, sad, surprised) using DeepFace.
Screen Time Tracking: It tracks how much time you spend looking at the screen (on-screen time) versus away from it (off-screen time).
Features:
Emotion Analysis:
Detects faces in real-time.
Predicts the dominant emotion for each detected face.
Displays the emotion on the screen.
Screen Time Tracking:
Calculates on-screen and off-screen time.
Alerts with a buzzer sound if off-screen time exceeds a threshold.
Records maximum on-screen and off-screen times in an Excel sheet.
How It Works:
Dependencies:
Requires OpenCV (cv2), DeepFace, and Openpyxl.
Make sure you have a working webcam.
Run the Application:
Execute the Python script.
Press ‘q’ to exit.
Results:
Real-time emotion detection displayed on the screen.
Max on-screen and off-screen times saved in timer_data.xlsx.
Example Use Cases:
Monitor screen time during work or study sessions.
Understand emotional reactions during video calls or online meetings.
